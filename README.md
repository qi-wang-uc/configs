Configure files for commonly used apps

Notes:
- The `_xxx` file/directory corresponds to the `.xxx` file/directory in `$HOME` folder.
- Please do not just rename the file/directory and replace the original ones. 
- Instead, copy the content and paste it to proper position to make sure it works as expected.
- Always backup the original files !
- vmdrc15 and vmdrc24 for 15 and 24 inch monitors, respectively.
